## "Sharp transition towards shared vocabularies in multi-agent systems"
## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project implements an **agent-based model** to study opinion spreading and consensus formation on different network structures.  
The aim is to explore how **network topology** and **interaction rules** affect the **time to consensus** and overall opinion dynamics.

## ðŸ§  Model Description

### Agents
- Each agent represents an individual with a **binary opinion** (0 or 1).

### Network Topologies
- **ErdÅ‘sâ€“RÃ©nyi (Random network)**
- **Wattsâ€“Strogatz (Small-world network)**
- **BarabÃ¡siâ€“Albert (Scale-free network)**

### Interaction Rule
At each time step:
1. Select a random agent.
2. Select one of its neighbors at random.
3. The agent adopts the neighbor's opinion.

This process repeats until consensus is reached (all agents share the same opinion).

## ðŸ“Š Key Results
| Network Type       | Finding |
|-------------------|--------|
| Random Network    | Reaches consensus quickly but with high variability. |
| Small-World       | Moderate consensus time; clustering slows convergence slightly. |
| Scale-Free        | Slowest consensus due to influence bottlenecks at hubs. |

## ðŸ“¦ Dependencies
- networkx â€“ Network generation & analysis  
- numpy â€“ Numerical operations  
- matplotlib â€“ Visualization  
- jupyter â€“ Notebook interface  

---

## ðŸš€ Possible Extensions
- Introduce **stubborn agents** (zealots) and measure their effect on consensus time.
- Simulate **multi-opinion models** (e.g., more than two opinions).
- Measure **polarization metrics** instead of only consensus time.
